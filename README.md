For better UX, its good to add:
- smooth scroll
- redirect URLS
- if scroll to section, then menu FIXED? or at least an arrow to take you back to the TOP :)

For better code is nice to think about:
- replace star with dashes by SVG, with CSS its xxxx times faster, but not that responsive ;)
- a little better scss structure, but it's ultra small project
- add js aka JSON to set texts and elements in DOM
- expand FORM to make it workable.
